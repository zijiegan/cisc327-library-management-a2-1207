Compare implementation against requirements_specification.md.  
Use statuses: Complete / Partial, and describe what is missing if any.

| Function name | Implementation status (Complete/Partial) | What is missing (if any) |
|---|---|---|
| R1: Add Book To Catalog | Complete | — |
| R2: Book Catalog Display | Complete | — |
| R3: Book Borrowing Interface | Complete | — |
| R4: Book Return Processing | Missing | Not implemented: needs to verify borrow record, update availability, record return date, calculate late fees |
| R5: Late Fee Calculation API | Missing | Not implemented: must calculate overdue days, apply $0.50/day for first 7 days, $1.00/day after, maximum $15 |
| R6: Book Search Functionality | Missing | Not implemented: needs partial matching for title/author (case-insensitive) and exact matching for ISBN |
| R7: Patron Status Report | Missing | Not implemented: needs to show borrowed books with due dates, total late fees, number of borrowed books, borrowing history |


## Unit Tests Summary

Unit tests were written using the pytest framework and stored in the `tests/` directory.  
Each functional requirement (R1–R7) is covered with at least 4–5 test cases, including both positive and negative scenarios.  
The purpose of these tests is to validate implemented features and to reveal missing or incomplete functionality as specified in the requirements.

- R1: `test_add_book.py`  
  Tests valid book addition, missing/invalid fields, duplicate ISBN, and edge cases.

- R2: Book catalog display is implemented as a web interface; no unit tests were written for this requirement.

- R3: `test_borrow_book.py`  
  Tests successful borrowing, invalid patron IDs, unavailable books, borrowing limits, and database failures.

- R4: `test_return_book.py`  
  Tests expected return process including record update, availability update, invalid patron IDs, and error handling.  
  (Current implementation is missing; tests highlight unimplemented logic.)

- R5: `test_late_fee.py`  
  Tests overdue calculations for 0, 3, and 10 days, fee capping at $15, and missing records.  
  (Current implementation is missing; tests highlight unimplemented logic.)

- R6: `test_search_books.py`  
  Tests partial matching by title/author, exact ISBN matching, invalid search types, and empty queries.  
  (Current implementation is missing; tests highlight unimplemented logic.)

- R7: `test_patron_status.py`  
  Tests the expected structure of the patron status report, borrowed items with due dates, late fee reporting, borrowed count, and borrowing history.  
  (Current implementation is missing; tests highlight unimplemented logic.)

Overall, the tests confirm that R1 and R3 are implemented successfully, while R4–R7 remain unimplemented and R2 is realized only in the UI.
